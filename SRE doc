Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)

1. Why SRE?
In today’s digital world, businesses rely heavily on always-on applications and services. Users expect fast, reliable, and uninterrupted experiences. Even a few minutes of downtime can lead to revenue loss, customer dissatisfaction, and damage to brand reputation.
Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) was introduced to solve this challenge by combining software engineering practices with IT operations to ensure systems are:
Highly available
Scalable
Performant
Resilient to failures
SRE helps organisations move from reactive firefighting to proactive reliability management.

2. What is SRE?
Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is a discipline that applies software engineering principles to infrastructure and operations problems. The goal is to build and run reliable systems at scale.
Originally developed at Google, SRE focuses on automating operations tasks, improving system reliability, and balancing feature development with stability.
In simple terms: SRE ensures that applications run smoothly in production with minimal downtime and maximum performance.



3. What Can an SRE Do?
An SRE is responsible for maintaining service reliability while enabling rapid development.
Key Responsibilities
Designing and maintaining highly reliable systems
Monitoring system health and performance
Automating repetitive operational tasks
Managing incidents and outages
Implementing disaster recovery strategies
Capacity planning and scalability management
Ensuring security and compliance
Reducing manual intervention through automation
Typical Tools Used
Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog
Logging: ELK Stack, Splunk
Cloud Platforms: AWS, Azure, GCP
Containers: Docker, Kubernetes
CI/CD: Jenkins, GitHub Actions
Infrastructure as Code: Terraform, Ansible


4.  DevOps vs SRE

 Simple Difference
DevOps focuses on how fast you can deliver software.
SRE focuses on how reliably the software runs.
Both work together to achieve continuous delivery with high reliability.

 5. Core SRE Principles (Golden Rules)
1. Service Level Objectives (SLOs)
Define clear reliability targets such as uptime and response time.
2. Service Level Indicators (SLIs)
Measure actual system performance (latency, availability, error rate).
3. Service Level Agreements (SLAs)
Formal agreements with customers based on SLOs.

4. Error Budget
Defines how much failure is acceptable.
If error budget remains → release new features faster
If error budget is exhausted → focus on stability
This creates a balance between innovation and reliability.

5. Automation First
Automate repetitive and manual operations to reduce human errors.

6. Monitoring and Observability
Continuous tracking of system health to detect issues early.

7. Incident Management
Quickly detect, respond, and resolve failures.
Root Cause Analysis (RCA)
Postmortem reports
Continuous improvement

8. Scalability and Capacity Planning
Ensure systems handle growth without performance degradation.

9. Blameless Culture
Failures are learning opportunities, not personal faults.

 Benefits of Implementing SRE
Reduced downtime
Faster incident recovery
Improved system stability
Better customer satisfaction
Efficient use of engineering time
Strong balance between speed and reliability

 Conclusion
Site Reliability Engineering is essential for modern organizations that aim to deliver fast, scalable, and highly reliable services. By integrating engineering practices into operations, SRE bridges the gap between development speed and system stability.
